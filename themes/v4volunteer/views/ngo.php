<p>'Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’

<p>The above quote by Margaret Mead holds true for the NGO community. The unwavering, passionate, and irrational commitment NGOs show case, it reflects the concerns of these organizations for the betterment of the society. India which has more than one NGO for every 400 Indians still do not get the benefits of this ever expanding human moral police force community. While working on this initiative, we discussed the problem active NGOs face and realized that there are three major bottlenecks: a platform to showcase their activities and new initiatives, a platform to interact with the active as well as willing volunteers, a platform to report requirements for involving new volunteers for any project/initiative.
</p>
</br>
<p>Our initiative tackles all these problems in a single platform. We welcome all organizations including charitable, civic, social, educational, and governmental to participate in our growing community.
</p>

How this platform helps an NGO:
	<ul style="margin-left:50px">
<li>Please fill in the Online <a href = "<?php echo url::site(); ?>reports/submit?type=2" target= "_blank">NGO registration form</a>, reporting about your organization, the activities you are involved in and the locations where you are active.
</li>
<li>Once you fill in the form, your information is available to everyone and is visually also tagged on the map on the specified location under a specific category.
</li>
<li>Also once you register, you get a platform to market the NGO posting activities, new initiatives, requirements for volunteers in particular area, etc.
</li>
<li>Communication between you and the Volunteer is two way. Both have access to the information available on the site. Proactively, an NGO can contact a like-minded willing volunteer using his information from the site. Or, a Volunteer can contact an NGO of his/her interest.
</li>
</ul>
