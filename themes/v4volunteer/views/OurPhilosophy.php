	The Volunteers in the active NGOs work for a variety of reasons. Some work on the ground of philanthropic values whereas some see volunteering as a way to enable the lesser privileged in a society while others want to seek social justice.
 For most of the volunteers, motivation for Volunteering comes to give something back to the society which has given us so much. And in most of the cases, we strongly believe in or care about certain issues or causes. Whatever be the reason, volunteerism bring a positive transformation in you and the world around you.
 And the best part in today's world, 'Volunteerism' is not confined to any particular group of people such as social activists, students, youth, housewives, elderly or any other such groups. It is also the working professionals with in corporate houses with diverse backgrounds including lawyers, engineers, managers, doctors contributing their knowledge and experience to the development sector. But what is lacking here when we as an individual want to bring about a change in the society in whatever form either alone or working with an NGO. The answer is "Lack of information and available opportunities". And what is the problem that the NGOs currently face? The answer is a platform to showcase their activities. A platform for them to engage with the willing volunteers and involving them in their activities. A platform for them to market themselves to gain visibility and attract volunteers. Our platform will fill all these gaps. Moreover, the platform being dynamic and scalable in itself can sustain on its own given that the information is transparently available for both the NGOs and the volunteers to see. NGOs can update their ongoing activities, market themselves, and look for like-minded volunteers. Whereas, the volunteers can express their aspirations. What kind of social activity they want to do and for what time and duration and in which location. The associated NGO can access that information and can contact the volunteer or Volunteer can access the available information about NGOs and can contact NGO based on his preference and can check about the available volunteering activities. You can start volunteering activity right away by sharing this website among your friends and let everyone together bridge the gap between the volunteers and the NGOs.
