<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm" align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><font size="4">To start off, our website is powered by Ushahidi platform build for a social cause. Moreover, this crowdsourcing platform is dynamic in itself and the users develop the data store of volunteers and NGOs and have communication platform available among themselves without intervention of us. Moreover, there is nothing called stale information in the site as it is dynamically updated with time stamps by users and the entire information is tagged on the map for easy accessibility by locations. This site also serves as an online platform for the NGOs to show case their activities and raise awareness about their organization. They also get platform to take new volunteers matching their initiatives. They can check the enthusiasm about their new initiative among the community by posting on the website and can take their future decisions based on it.
We will not be behind in this dynamic platform. We will also proactively expand our network with new NGOs and also monitor the type of aspirations volunteers mention and will contact the relevant NGOs. Given that NGOs will be able to report their activities/causes, this whole initiative will be self-sustaining for creating the network between the NGOs and the Volunteers and the information reported will be there for everyone to see.
