<p>What everyone wants is the acknowledgement for it.</p>
<p>What just lives in is procrastination.</p>
<p>Ultimately everyone wants to make a change someday.</p>
<p>Is there someone to start today? Now?</p>
<p>To beat the drum and get it rolling?” </p>

<p>Our mission is simple: We want to bridge the gap between the Volunteers and the NGOs and create a two-way communication platform between them so that like-minded people come together and make a change for the betterment of the society. We also want active as well as who aspire to volunteer feel that they are not alone and we all are one big family who may be separated by geographical locations but have a single goal to do something for the society.  So you, too, can say:  v4volunteer… do you?
Volunteering these days encompasses spectrum of things impacting our society. You can be a teacher to the under privileged, friend to special kids, or companion to the elderly. It does not stop you here. You can sometimes organize a fund raiser, sometimes help an NGO in its marketing. Even things as simple as reporting that you have excess food at some party and want to give it to the poor. Just report it in on our site and the relevant NGOs can see and make sure the food is rightly channelled if properly planned. You do not have time to volunteer but you see something suspicious around and know NGOs can definitely improve this. Report it on our site and the relevant NGOs will have access to that information. You decide your time commitment, preferred location and area of interest; v4volunteer will provide you the platform to report this.

A special mention to the people who have not done any volunteering but want to do. There are a couple of reasons why you should get into it right away. There is one most fundamental notion in Physics: “You cannot drag a chair while sitting on top of it”. This notion aptly explains why Volunteering is an important activity to bring a change in the society. It makes an important economic contribution to society. If it weren't for volunteers, many activities would have had to be supported by the Government or private funding which is hard to come by in Indian context. Volunteering helps channelize these funds into other areas. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, volunteering is an altruistic activity which helps build strong and cohesive communities. It fosters trust between citizens and helps develop norms of solidarity and reciprocity, which are essential for stable communities to flourish.

Volunteering is also sustainable on the same give and take policy and it has its share of delightful perks also. It gives you a chance to travel, meet new people, and acquire life & career enhancing experiences and skills. Above all, nobody can quantify the self-worth and respect it brings. The best part is it does not require a special degree or prior experience. It is simply a willingness to help. Commitment, enthusiasm, interest, skills, and willingness is all what you need.
